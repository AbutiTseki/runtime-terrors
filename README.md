Overview
This repository contains the source code for an educational tool designed to assist students in learning about algorithms and data structures, with a focus on linked lists. This tool provides a user-friendly interface for practicing and testing knowledge related to linked lists, a fundamental data structure in computer science.

Features
Linked List Visualization: A graphical user interface (GUI) for visualizing and interacting with linked lists, making it easier for students to grasp the concept.

Problem Generation: The system can generate a variety of linked list-related problems on the fly, along with their solutions, to help students practice and learn.

Algorithm Testing: Students can test their understanding of various linked list algorithms and operations, such as insertion, deletion, traversal, and more.

User-Friendly Interface: The tool offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface that students can use for self-study and practice.
